# RL Training in simulation environment
This code is for training the RL policy of the T-NT in the designed simulation environment.

## Simulation Environment
The environment will be released soon.

## RL training code
The code is in the script `gel_ppo.py`, which based on [stable_baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) and [pyrfuniverse](https://github.com/mvig-robotflow/pyrfuniverse).
You can run the code simply by:
```shell
python gel_ppo.py
```

It will create the trained model in a zip form, along with the success poking images.
